# To-Do-List-Chrome-Extension
<p>This is a simple to-do list extension coded in vanilla Javascript. It is currently a work in progress. In the future, I'd like to improve the functionality of the app, as well as add: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Customizable fonts and colors</li>
  <li>Dates and times so teh user can make due dates</li>
  <li>Alerts and sounds to notify the user</li>
 </ul>
